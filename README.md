# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Project
This project focuses on predicting the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic using historical data. Leveraging a dataset that includes features like age, gender, passenger class, and more, the project employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The model is trained using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, and its performance is evaluated to optimize accuracy. The project demonstrates the application of data science in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
